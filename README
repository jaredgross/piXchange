piXchange is a time capsule based photo sharing app. It allows users to create photo albums for events, invite friends, and upload photos to those albums. If the user creates the event as a ‘time capsule’ photos will be kept private from recipients, until the specified chosen date & time. If a ‘time capsule’ is not created, photos will be released to all recipients as soon as the ‘event timer’ expires.

Once photos have been uploaded for an event and the event timer has expired, users can filter, crop, or draw on their images and re-save them to the collective album.
